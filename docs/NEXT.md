# Baton — what the next session does

**T-37C is the one ticket.** T-37B built the accent's text tier and moved the nav label and three
hovers onto it: the tab label now measures **4.83:1** on Latte where it measured 4.45, proved by
smoke row 31 in the page, per flavour. That gave the tier a home — and, while measuring, it found
**two more pairs that are still short on the same tier**. T-37C finishes the sweep. It needs no
backend, no toolchain and no dependency, and the walk can measure both halves.

## T-37C — the rest of the accent's text joins the tier

**Why it is next.** It is the last unchecked item in P6 that is neither backend nor toolchain, and it
is the same defect T-37B just fixed, one surface over. Two measured failures are already recorded in
`docs/DESIGN.md` → *Contrast*:

- **The base link rule.** `src/styles.css`: `a { color: var(--color-accent) }` — every link that has
  no class of its own — paints the **mark** as text: **4.45:1** on Latte's `--color-bg-elevated` and
  **3.51:1** on `--color-surface`. Its hover, `a:hover { color: var(--color-accent-hover) }`
  (lavender), is **2.62:1** on bg-elevated — the worst pair in the app.
- **The `md` rail label.** `.rail-item.is-active` paints `--color-surface` behind the label. Even the
  new tier measures **3.81:1** there on Latte (the mark was 3.51), so this one is **not** a token
  swap: the fill is the row's only `md` indicator (the 2px bar appears at `lg`), and a light-filled
  row cannot carry accent text at 4.5 with this palette.

**The decision (take it, do not re-open it in the baton).**

1. **Text** goes to `--color-accent-text`: `a`, and a hover that is text. The hover needs a tier of
   its own — do **not** point `a:hover` at `--color-accent-hover` (lavender is 2.62:1 on Latte and
   8.1:1 on Mocha, so it cannot be one value). Declare `--color-accent-hover-text` beside
   `--color-accent-text` in every flavour block: the mark's hover value on dark, and a mix toward
   `--ctp-text` on Latte that measures ≥ 4.6 on **both** `--color-bg-elevated` and `--color-surface`
   (that is what "a link on a card" means). Compute the mix, do not guess: 85/15 landed 4.83 / 3.81,
   so this hover needs roughly **55/45** to clear a card backplate — check the number before shipping
   and if the hue goes muddy, say so in DESIGN and ship the surface change instead.
2. **The `md` rail** stops filling. Either drop the `--color-surface` backplate on light flavours or
   move the active indicator to a **mark** (a left bar, as `lg` already draws) so the label sits on
   `--color-bg-elevated` (4.83). Record whichever in `docs/DESIGN.md` → *Layout law*, because it is a
   design decision, not a token.
3. **Every remaining `color: var(--color-accent)` is text.** Sweep them in the same commit:
   `.persona-card-mark`, `a.persona-card-open:hover`, `.post-comments:hover`,
   `.tab-pill[aria-selected="true"] .tab-count`. Nothing that is a **fill** moves —
   `.btn-primary`, `.toggle-track`, `.cat-tab::after`, `.tab-pill::after`, the input focus borders,
   the tab tick, the rail bar and the focus ring all keep `--color-accent`.

**Approach**

1. `src/styles.css` + `src/App.tsrx`: the two tokens in all six blocks, then the sweep above.
2. **Extend smoke row 31** (do not add a row — the row already owns the flavoured contrast proof):
   measure `a` and `a:hover` with `CSS.forcePseudoState`, on `/character/catalog` where a printed
   link sits on a card, and assert ≥ 4.5 per flavour. Extend the `md` half with
   `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` at 900 **inside the same `try`/`finally`** as the media
   emulation, and assert the rail label clears 4.5 after your fill decision. Keep `EXPECTED_ROWS`
   at 31 — a row that grows is a row, a row that multiplies is a trap.
3. `docs/DESIGN.md` → *Contrast* carries the new pairs and the measured numbers in the same commit.

**Traps**

- **`color-mix()` computes to `color(srgb 0.49 0.23 0.85)`**, 0–1 floats, not `rgb(…)`. Parsing that
  as bytes turned 4.83:1 into a fake **17.23:1** on T-37B's first run — `CONTRAST_FN` in
  `scripts/smoke.mjs` now handles both forms; reuse it, never re-roll it.
- **Mix toward `--ctp-text`, never `--ctp-crust`,** to darken a light flavour. Crust is the lightest
  Latte step: mixing toward it *lightens* the accent (88/12 → 3.82:1) and makes the pair worse.
- **`CSS.forcePseudoState` is the honest way to measure `:hover`** and needs both `DOM.enable` and
  `CSS.enable` first; resolve the node with `DOM.getDocument` + `DOM.querySelector`. Release it with
  `forcedPseudoClasses: []` or the next row inherits a hovered element.
- **Assert the flavour actually landed** (`--ctp-base` is `#1e1e2e` dark / `#eff1f5` light) before
  trusting a ratio: a light pass that never switched measures Mocha against itself.
- **A red walk first.** T-37B set the tier back to `var(--ctp-mauve)` and watched row 31 read
  `4.45:1` before restoring — do the same for the new pairs, and remember a `replace` across the
  whole stylesheet hits the **dark** blocks too (that mistake made the dark flavour print `9.09:1`
  with `#cbadf7`: the fix is context-anchored, not a global swap).
- **No regex escapes inside the `CONTRAST_FN` template literal** — one `\\` inside a template string
  is a double-escaping trap; `s.indexOf("color(") === 0` is what shipped.

**Accept:** `./scripts/check.sh` GREEN, walk **31/31** locally **and** `--live`, row 31 printing the
`a`/`a:hover`/rail ratios per flavour at ≥ 4.5, `publish.sh` prints `LIVE`, `curl` 200.

## Driving the desktop window (recipe, proven 2026-11-01)

The webview half of T-33B(a) is verified; this is how, so a later ticket does not rediscover it.

```bash
cd /home/viicell/Projects/LuaPlot
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 \
       HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE=$(ls /run/user/1000/hypr/ | head -1)
bun run tauri dev &            # run it as a tracked background process, never with nohup
sleep 20 && hyprctl clients -j | jq -c '.[] | select(.class=="luaplot") | {mapped,at,size}'
grim -g "967,38 941x1030" /tmp/shot.png     # geometry from `at` + `size`, not x/width
```

- **`computer_use` sees nothing here** (`list_windows` → 0) because the cron env has no display; Hyprland
  0.56 also has no click dispatch (`hyprctl dispatch focuswindow class:x` fails — Lua dispatch syntax).
  So drive **keyboard-only** with `wtype -k Tab -k Tab … -k Return`, and read every step back with `grim`
  + `vision_analyze`. Never assert the window state from a key sequence alone.
- **The focus ladder that works from a fresh load:** 8× `Tab` → the top-right *More* button (7× lands on
  *Back*), `Return` opens the menu, 4× `Tab` → the session row (*Sign out* / *Sign in as @you*),
  `Return` presses it. Verify the focus ring in a cropped `grim` before pressing.
- **Ground truth is WebKit's own store:** `sqlite3 -readonly
  ~/.local/share/com.viicell.luaplot/localstorage/http_localhost_1420.localstorage
  "select key, quote(value) from ItemTable"` → `luaplot.session` as **UTF-16LE** hex: `null` when signed
  out, `{"handle":"you","displayName":"You"}` when signed in (never `isAdmin`).
- **`pkill -x luaplot` ends the whole `bun run tauri dev`**; relaunching takes ~20s (cargo is warm).
- **A desktop notification can sit over the window's top-right corner** and hide the *More* button in
  a capture. The menu renders inside the body, so the session row is still readable — crop below the toast
  rather than concluding the menu did not open.
- Cron's shell guard refuses `bash -c` / `node -e`; put scripts in a file (or use `jq`). It also
  refuses `rm` under a root path — clean scratch files with Python's `os.remove`, or leave them in
  `$TMPDIR` (`~/.hermes/cache/scratch`).

## Blocked — what a human must do

- **T-29/T-30/T-31/T-32 (Supabase):** create a project and export `SUPABASE_URL` +
  `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (server key stays out of the client). Nothing about the data seam can move past
  the memory adapter until then. T-30 also owns the real auth body (`lib/auth.ts` writes no session
  today) and the redirect matrix; T-29's migration is the first thing after the ref lands.
- **T-33B(b) deep link (desktop):** needs `tauri-plugin-deep-link` + a `luaplot://` scheme in the
  bundle config — a dependency, and the contract forbids one the ticket does not name.
- **T-33B(c) `Ctrl/Cmd+K`:** a decision, not work — no spec file describes a command palette. Record
  it in `docs/DESIGN.md` (what it lists, what it does, what it costs at 360px) or strike it.
- **T-35/T-36/T-39 (Android):** install cmdline-tools + platform 35 + NDK, the four rust android
  targets, then `tauri android init`.
- **Tauri on this box is NOT blocked — and the webview session proof is done.** `bun run tauri dev`
  opens, the account survives a restart in both directions, and the recipe above reproduces it.

## Open decisions

- **`/dev/data`'s vote is order-dependent but not fragile.** The row votes on whatever the adapter's
  newest character is *at that moment* (earlier journeys re-save rows), and it reads the name back
  from the log before comparing. Do not pin a character id.
- **The breakpoint row owns a CDP override.** Anything added after it must assume the session is back
  at 360×740; the row asserts that it cleared (`window.innerWidth === restore`) rather than trusting
  the `finally`. T-47's row 30 takes its own 360×740 override and clears it for the same reason, and
  T-37B's row 31 owns a **media** emulation with the same discipline (`features: []` in `finally`).
- **`follow()` drops the fragment on purpose** — a `/terms#anchor` link must stay a real document
  navigation (or gain scroll handling nothing needs yet). `ARCHITECTURE.md` → Router carries the rule
  and the three exemptions `scripts/link-check.mjs` encodes (fragment, `target=`, external).
- **A card's ratio rounds to whole percent**, so a one-vote change can leave the printed number
  identical (96% → 96%). A journey proving an engagement write must read a count (the detail page's
  Likes/Dislikes cells), never a card's percentage.
- **Row count is 31 (T-37B).** `scripts/smoke.mjs` keeps it in an explicit `EXPECTED_ROWS`, so a row
  that stops running is a red walk — bump it in the same commit as the row, and **extend** an
  existing row rather than adding a near-copy of it.
- **A 44px band is `line-height`/`min-height`, not `padding`.** Vertical padding on an inline `<a>` is
  hit-testable but invisible to layout, so a row that measures `getBoundingClientRect()` would pass
  while the row still collapsed; a flex item with `line-height: 44px` is the band the walk can see.
  A band that only hugs its text is still a small target: `flex: 1 1 auto` is what makes it 44 **wide**
  (T-47's first run failed at 36px wide on `@you`).
- **A token tier has a *surface* limit, not just a flavour limit.** `--color-accent-text` clears AA on
  `--color-bg` (5.20) and `--color-bg-elevated` (4.83) in Latte, and does **not** on
  `--color-surface` (3.81) — the same surface where `--color-text-muted` already fails (4.05). Latte's
  `surface-0` (`#ccd0da`) is the app's worst backplate; text above it should move to a fill-free
  layout rather than a darker token.

## Found while working (carried forward — keep this list growing)

- **A `color-mix()` value computes to `color(srgb 0.49 0.23 0.85)`** — 0–1 floats. A contrast helper
  that assumes 0–255 bytes reads it as near-black and reports a fake **17.23:1**. `CONTRAST_FN` in
  `scripts/smoke.mjs` branches on `indexOf("color(") === 0`; a regex escape inside that template
  literal is a double-escaping trap that produced exactly this bug twice.
- **`CSS.forcePseudoState` (`DOM.enable` + `CSS.enable` + `DOM.querySelector`) measures a `:hover`
  pair without a synthetic mouse** — the only honest way to assert a hover colour, and it must be
  released (`forcedPseudoClasses: []`) before the next measurement.
- **`Emulation.setEmulatedMedia { features: [{ name: "prefers-color-scheme", value }] }` is the
  flavour switch**; `features: []` clears it. Assert `--ctp-base` (`#1e1e2e` / `#eff1f5`) plus
  `color-scheme` to prove the pass really changed palette — a pinned `<html data-theme>` makes the
  media query inert and the row refuses to run against one.
- **Mixing toward `--ctp-crust` lightens a light flavour.** The mark's text tier darkens by mixing
  toward `--ctp-text`; the inverse reads like progress and measures worse (3.82 vs 4.83).
- **A global `s.replace` across `src/styles.css` hits the dark blocks too.** Restoring "the raw
  declaration" everywhere put the mix on Mocha and printed `9.09:1` with `#cbadf7` — anchor the
  replace on surrounding context (the flavour's `--ctp-lavender` line) or by line number.
- **A URL assertion cannot see a re-boot.** `waitUrl` is a substring match and a fresh document loads
  the same route; T-45 proves a push with **document identity** (`window` marker +
  `performance.timeOrigin`), and `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0].type` is `navigate`
  even for a full load from a link, so it cannot be the proof. `nav` is only printed as context.
- **The walk's own row count is a gate.** `process.exit(… rows.length === 27)` was a literal: adding
  row 28 with all 28 green still exited 1. It is `EXPECTED_ROWS` now — bump it with the row.
- **A red walk proves the assertion; a green one does not.** T-45 removed the `onClick`, rebuilt, and
  watched row 1 fail with the document dump before restoring it; T-47 set the band back to
  `line-height: 1.3` and watched row 30 read `16px tall`; T-37B put Latte's tier back on the mark and
  watched row 31 read `4.45:1`. Do that for any new invariant — and restore the exact bytes that
  passed, so the green run stays the proof.
- **Bare anchors are gone (T-46):** 52 internal anchors pair `href` with `follow`, `EmptyState` takes
  a **path** (`to=`) so its call sites cannot regress, and gate section 7 fails on a new one.
  The static check is the guard the walk cannot be: 31 rows cannot visit every page.
- **The webview stores `luaplot.session` as UTF-16LE in a SQLite table** (`localstorage/
  http_localhost_1420.localstorage`, `ItemTable`), so `quote(value)` returns hex — decode before
  comparing, or a correct proof reads as a corrupt one. On Pages the same key lives in the browser
  profile instead; the origin differs (`http://localhost:1420` in dev, `https://…/LuaPlot/` on Pages).
- **`localStorage` prints `null` for both "no key" and the stored string `"null"`.** A proof that only
  prints `getItem` cannot tell a fresh install from a signed-out device; compare with
  `JSON.stringify` or assert the DOM beside it.
- **A CDP reload is only honest at a URL the host actually serves.** GitHub Pages has no SPA fallback
  (`/LuaPlot/dev/state` → 404), so a session/persistence proof runs at the site root and reads the
  shell (`Sign out` vs `Sign in as @you`, `prefsLine`'s sentence) instead of `/dev/state`.
- **A publish is not instantly walkable.** Two `/dev/*` rows timed out on a live walk started ~25s after
  `publish.sh` and passed on the re-run: a mid-propagation chunk 404 looks identical to a broken page.
  (A failure that survives a re-run is real — that is how T-45's doubled base was caught.)
- **A `cargo build` debug binary loads `devUrl`, not `frontendDist`.** It opens a mapped window that
  says *Could not connect to localhost: Connection refused* — the app is fine, vite is missing. The
  accept command is `bun run tauri dev`; and `dist` must be built **without** `LUAPLOT_BASE` for Tauri
  (the app is served from `tauri://localhost`, so `/LuaPlot/assets/…` 404s).
- **The desktop is drivable from cron without a display** — see *Driving the desktop window* above.
- **A tiling compositor overrides the configured window size.** `tauri.conf.json` asks for 1200×900 and
  Hyprland maps it at 941×1030. That is the WM, not a config bug — the *floor* (`minWidth`/`minHeight`)
  and the label are the parts the app controls, which is why `scripts/tauri-config.mjs` asserts those.
- **`pkill -f vite` kills the tick's own shell**, because the pattern matches the command line that is
  running it. Kill a preview by port: `lsof -ti:4321 | xargs -r kill`. Use `pkill -x luaplot` for the app.
- **Never pipe `scripts/smoke.sh` into `tail`/`head`/`grep`.** A pipeline hands back the *pager's*
  status, so a red walk exits 0, and `smoke: N/31 journeys` is the first line the pipe drops — the run
  looks green and proves nothing. Redirect to a file, then read the file and the exit code.
- **T-44's walk helpers are the ones to reuse**: `setToggle(label, want)` / `toggleState` (press a
  `button.toggle`, then **poll the rendered `aria-pressed`**), `storeCell(label)`, `coveredCards()`,
  `measureAt(width)` and the `BREAKPOINTS` table.
- **The card grid is 1 / 2 / 3 / 3, not 1 / 2 / 3 / 4.** Measured ladder live: `360:1col/field1/rail0/
  btn44/outlet340 · 640:2col/field2/rail0/btn44/outlet620 · 900:3col/field2/rail84/btn44/outlet794 ·
  1200:3col/field2/rail240/btn44/outlet794`, no document-level horizontal scroll at any width — and
  still exactly these numbers after T-47 made the card footer 44 tall (the height did not enter the
  track math).
- **`.count-label` carries `text-transform: uppercase`** and `innerText` returns the *rendered* text
  (`SHOW`, `LIKES`): a case-sensitive label match finds nothing and reads as a broken page.
- **`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` is the only honest way to change width**, and a leak poisons
  every later row. `measureAt` runs in `try`, the clear + 240ms settle in `finally`.
- **`/dev/state`'s NSFW pair is restored, not merely flipped.** A journey that leaves Show+Blur on
  makes every later card-grid assertion read the wrong state.
- **The `--live` walk catches what the local one cannot.** T-41 lost three rows to an `^`-anchored path
  test, T-42 to a missing `/edit`, T-45 to a doubled base that base `/` hides. Suffix-match every path,
  run `--live` before claiming a ticket.
- **A refusal row must carry the whole path.** T-42's first run failed three rows because `OTHER_*`
  omitted the trailing `/edit` and the failure read like a copy bug.
- **A `<input type=file>` in headless Chromium hangs the press unless intercepted.**
  `Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog { enabled: true }` before the press, `backendNodeId` from the
  event, then `DOM.setFileInputFiles` — which fires `change`.
- **Do not pin an engine's answer.** `navigator.vibrate` answers truthy here (155) and measured `false`
  in T-34: a row whose value comes from the browser asserts a **set** and names the member it saw.
- **`document.title` on a non-root route is `<Title> — LuaPlot`** (`App.tsrx`), so the badge reads
  `(3) Native — LuaPlot`.
- **T-41 is done**: `retype()` and `choose()` are the helpers for a preloaded field (`type()` appends at
  wherever `focus()` left the caret). **T-40 is done** (`/character/[id]/edit` mounts `CharacterForm`
  only in its `ready` branch). **T-34 is done**: `native.ts` answers `nativeResultSchema`;
  `isNative()` reads `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, never `import.meta.env`.
- **The Tauri chunk is `core-*.js` and no file in `dist` contains the literal `@tauri-apps`** — only
  the resource timing can prove it never loads (`noCoreChunk`).
- **A synthetic `.click()` cannot copy**: `navigator.clipboard.writeText` needs a trusted gesture.
- **T-38 is done**: `scripts/smoke.sh` builds + previews + walks + tears down; `--live` walks the Pages
  URL. **It is not in `check.sh`** — the gate stays browser-free.
- **The account page is not a `<form>`.** `user-edit.tsrx` draws `.form` as a `div` of `Field`s, so a
  row must assert an input by `name` (`input[name="displayName"]`), never `querySelector("form")`.
- **A component that hands out a link must take the path, not the href.** `EmptyState` took a finished
  `href` and drew a bare anchor; 39 call sites were one attribute away from the exploit. Ownership of
  the `href`+`follow` pair inside the component is what stopped it — apply that to any new one.
- **`link-check.mjs` reads tags, not lines.** Attributes span lines (the tab bar and the dev pages do),
  so the scanner walks from `<a` to the matching `>` counting braces, quotes and backticks; a
  line-based grep would miss exactly the multi-line cases it exists for.
- **The report journey needs POST(8)**: the preview classifier buckets on `hash("jev:post:" + body) % 5`
  and only buckets 2/3/4 escalate.
- **A shared Chromium profile makes the walk flake** — profiles are unique per run and removed on exit.
- **`go()` must resolve against the served base**; a leading slash drops the `/LuaPlot/` base.
- **Measure a flavour through `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia`**, never by flipping `data-theme` from JS.
- **`/bookmarks` carries an internal horizontal scroller** (`.tabs`, `overflow-x: auto`); the
  **document** does not scroll. The breakpoint row asserts `documentElement`.
- **`:has()` is available in the walk's Chromium** (`Chromium 105+`), and it is the only way to pick
  "the first card that actually draws an author link" in one selector (T-47's row 30) without
  flattening the whole grid into the page expression.
- **Bundle numbers**: `dist` 1.1 MB; JS 728 KB raw / ~187 KB gz; CSS 23.8 KB gz; largest asset the
  JetBrains Mono Latin woff2 at 40,404 B. Budget 300 KB gz — met.
- **T-28B is done**: `postStatusSchema` (`visible | removed`), `removePost()`, `livePost()`,
  `getPost` still answers by id.
- **Counts** (memory adapter; the walk's own journeys add rows as they run, so never assert a bare
  total): characters 28 (27 public), lorebooks 6 (5 public), presets 5, personas 3, posts 12 (11 listed,
  post 6 removed), reports 5 (3 open, 2 concluded), comments 22, sessions 2, bookmarks 8 (one dead),
  notifications 6 (3 unread), profiles 7, follow edges 15. `/dev/data`'s *Characters* cell reads the
  **page** count (24 = `PAGE_SIZE`), not the fixture total.
