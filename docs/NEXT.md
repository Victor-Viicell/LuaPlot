# Baton — what the next session does

**T-50 is the one ticket.** T-49 landed: `scripts/smoke.mjs` has row **33**, the walk is **33/33**
locally and live, and *sessions read copies, never live items* is no longer the one product law with
no row. The next law with no mechanical guard is *personas are personal (never shared, never
moderated, never counted)* — a law about **absences**, which is exactly what a hand sweep forgets.

## T-50 — a persona carries none of the shared-item chrome

**Why it is next.** `CONTRACT.md` → *Product law*: **"Personas are personal (never shared, never
moderated, never counted)."** `src/specs/pages/persona/detail.md` fixes it in the negative — *"No
engagement row, no report control, and no comment thread … nothing about it is counted"* — and
`collection.md` adds *"personas are absent from profiles and never shared"*. The walk reaches
`/persona/[id]` only through row 13's edit journey, which lands on the form; **no row has ever read
the absences**, and a control that quietly appears one day (a Report button copied in from a template,
an engagement strip, a comment count) is invisible to every existing gate: `link-check.mjs` reads
anchors, `tier-check.mjs` reads colours, `spec-routes.mjs` reads routes. None of them can see "there
is no such element".

**Approach**

1. One new row, **row 34** (bump `EXPECTED_ROWS` 33 → 34). Open an own persona's detail page —
   `go("/persona/9e45014a-0000-4000-8000-000000000001")` — poll for `.detail h1.name`, and read the
   name back so a later fixture rename is a red row, not a silent pass.
2. Assert the **absences** within the page's own root (`.detail`), never against `document.body`:
   zero `button`/`a` whose accessible name matches `/report/i`, zero elements matching
   `.counts, .count, .ratio, .engagement`, zero comment thread (`.comments`, `.comment-thread`,
   `.comment`), zero save/bookmark control. Absence is asserted by **counting elements inside the
   page root**, not by searching the text: an earlier row's toast, or a footer that says "report",
   would make a text search pass on a page that still has the button.
3. Assert `/persona` is **own-only**: the collection's `.card-cell` count equals the number of cards
   read (`3` today — personas are seeded for `you` only), and every card links to a `/persona/<uuid>`
   path under the served base. Do not pin a total without reading the cards first: the count is the
   assertion, the number is evidence.
4. The refusal on a persona that is not yours: `go("/persona/9e45014a-0000-4000-8000-0000000000ff")`
   → the sentence **This persona doesn't exist in your collection.** and **no `<form>`** on the page.
   Missing and unowned are one state on purpose (`getPersona` answers `null` for both); say so in the
   row's comment.
5. Nothing is mutated: the row only reads, so its position after row 33 and before `sign out` is for
   tidiness, not safety — but keep it there, so `sign out` stays the walk's last row.

**Traps**

- **`innerText` is the rendered text.** `.copies-toggle` and `.copy-kind` carry `text-transform:
  uppercase`, so T-49's first run read `3 COPIES · 1 EDITED` and failed on a page that was correct.
  Read **`textContent`** for a sentence the code writes and `innerText` only when the rendering is the
  thing under test (T-49's lesson, now in *Found while working*).
- **Do not invent a selector for the next session.** Read `src/pages/persona-detail.tsrx` first: the
  page root is `.detail` inside `.page`, the name is `h1.name`, and the missing state is the shared
  `EmptyState` with a **path** (`to="/persona"`), not an href. If a selector below does not exist in
  the file, the row is mis-set, not the page broken.
- **The shell draws controls of its own** (the `More` menu, the tab bar). Scope every absence query to
  `.detail`; a `document.querySelector("button")` anywhere is the wrong node.
- **`/persona` is a searchable collection at 360** — the toolbar has a search field and a sort. Do not
  assume one card per row; count `.card-cell`, not columns.
- **The word "report" can arrive from a toast.** Row 33 restores a copy (toast *Copy restored.*) and
  rows 17–19 toast on cases; a text search would be flaky, an element count would not.

**Accept:** `./scripts/check.sh` GREEN; walk **34/34** locally and **34/34 `--live`**; row 34 proved
**red** first (e.g. add a `Report` button to the persona page's identity block, watch the row fail
naming the control it found, then restore the exact bytes and watch it green); `publish.sh` prints
`LIVE` and `curl` is 200.

## Driving the desktop window (recipe, proven 2026-11-01)


The webview half of T-33B(a) is verified; this is how, so a later ticket does not rediscover it.

```bash
cd /home/viicell/Projects/LuaPlot
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 \
       HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE=$(ls /run/user/1000/hypr/ | head -1)
bun run tauri dev &            # run it as a tracked background process, never with nohup
sleep 20 && hyprctl clients -j | jq -c '.[] | select(.class=="luaplot") | {mapped,at,size}'
grim -g "967,38 941x1030" /tmp/shot.png     # geometry from `at` + `size`, not x/width
```

- **`computer_use` sees nothing here** (`list_windows` → 0) because the cron env has no display; Hyprland
  0.56 also has no click dispatch (`hyprctl dispatch focuswindow class:x` fails — Lua dispatch syntax).
  So drive **keyboard-only** with `wtype -k Tab -k Tab … -k Return`, and read every step back with `grim`
  + `vision_analyze`. Never assert the window state from a key sequence alone.
- **The focus ladder that works from a fresh load:** 8× `Tab` → the top-right *More* button (7× lands on
  *Back*), `Return` opens the menu, 4× `Tab` → the session row (*Sign out* / *Sign in as @you*),
  `Return` presses it. Verify the focus ring in a cropped `grim` before pressing.
- **Ground truth is WebKit's own store:** `sqlite3 -readonly
  ~/.local/share/com.viicell.luaplot/localstorage/http_localhost_1420.localstorage
  "select key, quote(value) from ItemTable"` → `luaplot.session` as **UTF-16LE** hex: `null` when signed
  out, `{"handle":"you","displayName":"You"}` when signed in (never `isAdmin`).
- **`pkill -x luaplot` ends the whole `bun run tauri dev`**; relaunching takes ~20s (cargo is warm).
- **A desktop notification can sit over the window's top-right corner** and hide the *More* button in
  a capture. The menu renders inside the body, so the session row is still readable — crop below the toast
  rather than concluding the menu did not open.
- Cron's shell guard refuses `bash -c` / `node -e`; put scripts in a file (or use `jq`). It also
  refuses `rm` under a root path — clean scratch files with Python's `os.remove`, or leave them in
  `$TMPDIR` (`~/.hermes/cache/scratch`). **`execute_code` is blocked in this cron profile** — for
  arithmetic, write a `.py` under `$TMPDIR` and run `python3 <file>`.

## Blocked — what a human must do

- **T-29/T-30/T-31/T-32 (Supabase):** create a project and export `SUPABASE_URL` +
  `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (server key stays out of the client). Nothing about the data seam can move past
  the memory adapter until then. T-30 also owns the real auth body (`lib/auth.ts` writes no session
  today) and the redirect matrix; T-29's migration is the first thing after the ref lands.
- **T-33B(b) deep link (desktop):** needs `tauri-plugin-deep-link` + a `luaplot://` scheme in the
  bundle config — a dependency, and the contract forbids one the ticket does not name.
- **T-33B(c) `Ctrl/Cmd+K`:** a decision, not work — no spec file describes a command palette, and
  `luaplot-pages.md` is product law, so nothing may invent it. The owner must either record it in
  `docs/DESIGN.md` (what it lists, what it does, what it costs at 360px) or strike it from the ticket.
- **T-35/T-39 (Android + release):** install cmdline-tools + platform 35 + NDK, the four rust
  android targets, then `tauri android init`. T-39 also needs a signing key and a `v0.1.0` tag, so it
  follows T-35 and stays blocked. **T-36 is split:** (a) — the keyboard inset — **landed as T-36a** (`lib/viewport.ts`
  + walk row 32); the rest of T-36 — no clipped input **on a real APK**, hardware back-button mapping,
  60fps transcript scroll on device — still needs the toolchain above and stays blocked.
- **Tauri on this box is NOT blocked — and the webview session proof is done.** `bun run tauri dev`
  opens, the account survives a restart in both directions, and the recipe above reproduces it.

## Open decisions

- **Row count is 33 (T-49, after T-37B/T-37C extended theirs in place).** `scripts/smoke.mjs` keeps it in an explicit
  `EXPECTED_ROWS`, so a row that stops running is a red walk — **extend** an existing row rather than
  adding a near-copy of it, and bump the count only when a row is genuinely new.
- **Row 31 owns two CDP overrides and one probe.** It installs a classless `<a>` in the first card (no
  page prints one, and the base rule is the thing under test), measures it resting and through
  `CSS.forcePseudoState`, takes its own 900px `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` for the rail, and
  clears the media emulation, the metrics override *and* the probe in one `finally`. Anything added
  after it must assume 360×740 and no probe in the DOM.
- **The breakpoint row owns a CDP override.** Anything added after it must assume the session is back
  at 360×740; the row asserts that it cleared (`window.innerWidth === restore`) rather than trusting
  the `finally`. T-47's row 30 takes its own 360×740 override and clears it for the same reason.
- **`follow()` drops the fragment on purpose** — a `/terms#anchor` link must stay a real document
  navigation (or gain scroll handling nothing needs yet). `ARCHITECTURE.md` → Router carries the rule
  and the three exemptions `scripts/link-check.mjs` encodes (fragment, `target=`, external).
- **A card's ratio rounds to whole percent**, so a one-vote change can leave the printed number
  identical (96% → 96%). A journey proving an engagement write must read a count (the detail page's
  Likes/Dislikes cells), never a card's percentage.
- **`/dev/data`'s vote is order-dependent but not fragile.** The row votes on whatever the adapter's
  newest character is *at that moment* (earlier journeys re-save rows), and it reads the name back
  from the log before comparing. Do not pin a character id.
- **A 44px band is `line-height`/`min-height`, not `padding`.** Vertical padding on an inline `<a>` is
  hit-testable but invisible to layout, so a row that measures `getBoundingClientRect()` would pass
  while the row still collapsed; a flex item with `line-height: 44px` is the band the walk can see.
  A band that only hugs its text is still a small target: `flex: 1 1 auto` is what makes it 44 **wide**
  (T-47's first run failed at 36px wide on `@you`).
- **A token tier has a *surface* limit, not just a flavour limit.** `--color-accent-text` clears AA on
  `--color-bg` (5.20) and `--color-bg-elevated` (4.83) in Latte, and does **not** on
  `--color-surface` (3.81) — the same surface where `--color-text-muted` already fails (4.05). Latte's
  `surface-0` (`#ccd0da`) is the app's worst backplate; **a surface that cannot hold AA text loses the
  text, not the token** — that is what happened to the `md` rail's fill in T-37C, and the hover tier
  exists only because a *hover* still has to survive that backplate (4.66, which is why it is 40/60
  and not 55/45 = 4.38 or 60/40 = 4.29). Do not "restore" the lighter mix by eye.

- **Row count is 33 after T-49; 34 is T-50's.** Row 32 shadows `visualViewport.height`, takes its
  own 360×740 metrics override, and clears both in `finally`; anything added after it must assume the
  shadow is gone, the token is back to `0px` and the session is back at the browser's own window
  size (assert `innerWidth` returned, never trust the `finally`). **Row 33 is mutating**: it presses
  **Restore copy** on session 2, so session 2's character copy is `untouched` for the rest of the
  run — a later row that wants an `edited` copy must seed or edit its own.
- **The pressed-pill fill is a rule, not a one-off (T-48).** A control whose own background is
  `--color-surface` cannot hold static accent text in Latte; pressed means accent **fill** +
  `--color-accent-contrast`. `DESIGN.md` → *Contrast* carries it.

## Found while working (carried forward — keep this list growing)

- **`innerText` is the rendered text, so a `text-transform` redesigns the assertion (T-49).** The
  session copies header and each `.copy-kind` are uppercased in CSS, so row 33's first run read
  `3 COPIES · 1 EDITED` and failed on a page that was right. Read `textContent` for a sentence the
  code writes; use `innerText` only when what the reader sees is the thing under test.
- **A ticket's example strings are a hypothesis; the fixture is the fact (T-49).** T-49 predicted
  `4 copies · 1 edited` → `4 copies · 0 edited`. Session 2 holds **three** copies (character, one
  lorebook, preset) and `summary` appends ` · N edited` only while `N > 0`, so the truth was
  `3 copies · 1 edited` → `3 copies`. Four is session 1's two-lorebook shape, which is the example
  `DESIGN.md` quotes. Count the fixture before writing the assertion.
- **`Restore` and `Restore copy` are two different buttons.** The edited row's opener is labelled
  **Restore**; only the confirmation's button says **Restore copy**. Pressing by a `startsWith`
  match hits the opener, and a second press must be scoped to `.copy-confirm`, or the row proves the
  dialog and never the snapshot.
- **A hand sweep is a list; the gate is the guard (T-48).** T-37C moved every accent-text site it could
  see in `src/styles.css` and reported the tree clean — `scripts/tier-check.mjs` then found **26** more
  in `.tsrx` `<style>` blocks on its first run, including `.vote`/`.save` pressed pills on three pages.
  When a rule can be checked mechanically, the sweep is not done until the check exists.
- **A mark token in a *fallback* is still the mark.** `color: var(--color-success, var(--color-accent))`
  paints accent text whenever the first token is missing; the fix is the text tier in the fallback, not
  an exemption in the scanner.
- **Mask, don't skip, when extracting CSS from a `.tsrx`.** Replacing non-`<style>` characters with
  spaces (newlines kept) means an offset in the mask is an offset in the source, so `file:line` is the
  file's own line — no remapping pass to get wrong.
- **A scanner that takes file arguments can be proved red without touching the tree.** `node
  scripts/tier-check.mjs $TMPDIR/x.css` on a copy is the whole proof; copy that shape for the next
  static guard. An injected `<style>` must land *inside* the real block, or the tag text becomes part
  of the preceding selector and the message reads oddly.
- **`--color-accent-hover-text` clears `--color-surface` (4.66 Latte), but it is a hover's token.** There
  is no *static* accent text tier that clears that backplate, so a static site there is a design
  decision (fill, or drop the accent) — never a borrowed tier.
- **Cron's shell blocks `bash -c` / `node -e` and `execute_code`.** A sweep like T-48's is a `.py` file
  under `$TMPDIR` run with `python3`, and it must apply edits bottom-up per file so the line numbers it
  read stay valid.

- **A backtick inside a `js(…)` template literal ends the string.** A comment in row 31's page
  expression quoted `--color-surface` in backticks and node reported `Invalid left-hand side
  expression in postfix operation` at the snippet's *opening* line — no template-literal error, no
  pointer at the comment. Page snippets carry no backticks; write the token plainly.
- **A token with no element left on it can still be measured honestly.** The hover tier exists for
  `--color-surface`, which now paints no text at all (the rail's fill is gone), so row 31 resolves it
  through a throwaway `div` — set `style.backgroundColor = "var(--color-surface)"`, read the computed
  `backgroundColor`, remove it. The value is the browser's own, not a hex copied into the walk (a hex
  would keep passing after the token moved).
- **Two hovered nodes need two force/release pairs.** Forcing the author link and then reading the
  *probe's* `:hover` colour measures the author's rule; each node is forced, read and released in
  turn. Release is `forcedPseudoClasses: []`.
- **`color-mix()` computes to `color(srgb 0.49 0.23 0.85)`** — 0–1 floats. A contrast helper that
  assumes 0–255 bytes reads it as near-black and reports a fake **17.23:1**. `CONTRAST_FN` in
  `scripts/smoke.mjs` branches on `indexOf("color(") === 0`, and `cssHex()` makes the same branch for
  evidence; a regex escape inside that template literal is a double-escaping trap that produced
  exactly this bug twice.
- **`CSS.forcePseudoState` (`DOM.enable` + `CSS.enable` + `DOM.querySelector`) measures a `:hover`
  pair without a synthetic mouse** — the only honest way to assert a hover colour, and it must be
  released (`forcedPseudoClasses: []`) before the next measurement.
- **`Emulation.setEmulatedMedia { features: [{ name: "prefers-color-scheme", value }] }` is the
  flavour switch**; `features: []` clears it. Assert `--ctp-base` (`#1e1e2e` / `#eff1f5`) plus
  `color-scheme` to prove the pass really changed palette — a pinned `<html data-theme>` makes the
  media query inert and the row refuses to run against one.
- **Mixing toward `--ctp-crust` lightens a light flavour.** The mark's text tier darkens by mixing
  toward `--ctp-text`; the inverse reads like progress and measures worse (3.82 vs 4.83).
- **A global `s.replace` across `src/styles.css` hits the dark blocks too.** Restoring "the raw
  declaration" everywhere put the mix on Mocha and printed `9.09:1` with `#cbadf7` — anchor the
  replace on surrounding context (the flavour's `--ctp-lavender` line) or by line number.
- **A URL assertion cannot see a re-boot.** `waitUrl` is a substring match and a fresh document loads
  the same route; T-45 proves a push with **document identity** (`window` marker +
  `performance.timeOrigin`), and `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0].type` is `navigate`
  even for a full load from a link, so it cannot be the proof. `nav` is only printed as context.
- **The walk's own row count is a gate.** `process.exit(… rows.length === 27)` was a literal: adding
  row 28 with all 28 green still exited 1. It is `EXPECTED_ROWS` now — bump it with the row.
- **A red walk proves the assertion; a green one does not.** T-45 removed the `onClick`, rebuilt, and
  watched row 1 fail with the document dump before restoring it; T-47 set the band back to
  `line-height: 1.3` and watched row 30 read `16px tall`; T-37B put Latte's tier back on the mark and
  watched row 31 read `4.45:1`. Do that for any new invariant — and restore the exact bytes that
  passed, so the green run stays the proof.
- **Bare anchors are gone (T-46):** 52 internal anchors pair `href` with `follow`, `EmptyState` takes
  a **path** (`to=`) so its call sites cannot regress, and gate section 7 fails on a new one.
  The static check is the guard the walk cannot be: 31 rows cannot visit every page. (T-48 is the same
  argument for the colour tier.)
- **The webview stores `luaplot.session` as UTF-16LE in a SQLite table** (`localstorage/
  http_localhost_1420.localstorage`, `ItemTable`), so `quote(value)` returns hex — decode before
  comparing, or a correct proof reads as a corrupt one. On Pages the same key lives in the browser
  profile instead; the origin differs (`http://localhost:1420` in dev, `https://…/LuaPlot/` on Pages).
- **`localStorage` prints `null` for both "no key" and the stored string `"null"`.** A proof that only
  prints `getItem` cannot tell a fresh install from a signed-out device; compare with
  `JSON.stringify` or assert the DOM beside it.
- **A CDP reload is only honest at a URL the host actually serves.** GitHub Pages has no SPA fallback
  (`/LuaPlot/dev/state` → 404), so a session/persistence proof runs at the site root and reads the
  shell (`Sign out` vs `Sign in as @you`, `prefsLine`'s sentence) instead of `/dev/state`.
- **A publish is not instantly walkable.** Two `/dev/*` rows timed out on a live walk started ~25s after
  `publish.sh` and passed on the re-run: a mid-propagation chunk 404 looks identical to a broken page.
  (A failure that survives a re-run is real — that is how T-45's doubled base was caught.)
- **A `cargo build` debug binary loads `devUrl`, not `frontendDist`.** It opens a mapped window that
  says *Could not connect to localhost: Connection refused* — the app is fine, vite is missing. The
  accept command is `bun run tauri dev`; and `dist` must be built **without** `LUAPLOT_BASE` for Tauri
  (the app is served from `tauri://localhost`, so `/LuaPlot/assets/…` 404s).
- **The desktop is drivable from cron without a display** — see *Driving the desktop window* above.
- **A tiling compositor overrides the configured window size.** `tauri.conf.json` asks for 1200×900 and
  Hyprland maps it at 941×1030. That is the WM, not a config bug — the *floor* (`minWidth`/`minHeight`)
  and the label are the parts the app controls, which is why `scripts/tauri-config.mjs` asserts those.
- **`pkill -f vite` kills the tick's own shell**, because the pattern matches the command line that is
  running it. Kill a preview by port: `lsof -ti:4321 | xargs -r kill`. Use `pkill -x luaplot` for the app.
- **Never pipe `scripts/smoke.sh` into `tail`/`head`/`grep`.** A pipeline hands back the *pager's*
  status, so a red walk exits 0, and `smoke: N/31 journeys` is the first line the pipe drops — the run
  looks green and proves nothing. Redirect to a file, then read the file and the exit code.
- **T-44's walk helpers are the ones to reuse**: `setToggle(label, want)` / `toggleState` (press a
  `button.toggle`, then **poll the rendered `aria-pressed`**), `storeCell(label)`, `coveredCards()`,
  `measureAt(width)` and the `BREAKPOINTS` table.
- **The card grid is 1 / 2 / 3 / 3, not 1 / 2 / 3 / 4.** Measured ladder live: `360:1col/field1/rail0/
  btn44/outlet340 · 640:2col/field2/rail0/btn44/outlet620 · 900:3col/field2/rail84/btn44/outlet794 ·
  1200:3col/field2/rail240/btn44/outlet794`, no document-level horizontal scroll at any width — and
  still exactly these numbers after T-47 made the card footer 44 tall (the height did not enter the
  track math).
- **`.count-label` carries `text-transform: uppercase`** and `innerText` returns the *rendered* text
  (`SHOW`, `LIKES`): a case-sensitive label match finds nothing and reads as a broken page.
- **`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` is the only honest way to change width**, and a leak poisons
  every later row. `measureAt` runs in `try`, the clear + 240ms settle in `finally`.
- **`/dev/state`'s NSFW pair is restored, not merely flipped.** A journey that leaves Show+Blur on
  makes every later card-grid assertion read the wrong state.
- **The `--live` walk catches what the local one cannot.** T-41 lost three rows to an `^`-anchored path
  test, T-42 to a missing `/edit`, T-45 to a doubled base that base `/` hides. Suffix-match every path,
  run `--live` before claiming a ticket.
- **A refusal row must carry the whole path.** T-42's first run failed three rows because `OTHER_*`
  omitted the trailing `/edit` and the failure read like a copy bug.
- **A `<input type=file>` in headless Chromium hangs the press unless intercepted.**
  `Page.setInterceptFileChooserDialog { enabled: true }` before the press, `backendNodeId` from the
  event, then `DOM.setFileInputFiles` — which fires `change`.
- **Do not pin an engine's answer.** `navigator.vibrate` answers truthy here (155) and measured `false`
  in T-34: a row whose value comes from the browser asserts a **set** and names the member it saw.
- **`document.title` on a non-root route is `<Title> — LuaPlot`** (`App.tsrx`), so the badge reads
  `(3) Native — LuaPlot`.
- **T-41 is done**: `retype()` and `choose()` are the helpers for a preloaded field (`type()` appends at
  wherever `focus()` left the caret). **T-40 is done** (`/character/[id]/edit` mounts `CharacterForm`
  only in its `ready` branch). **T-34 is done**: `native.ts` answers `nativeResultSchema`;
  `isNative()` reads `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`, never `import.meta.env`.
- **The Tauri chunk is `core-*.js` and no file in `dist` contains the literal `@tauri-apps`** — only
  the resource timing can prove it never loads (`noCoreChunk`).
- **A synthetic `.click()` cannot copy**: `navigator.clipboard.writeText` needs a trusted gesture.
- **T-38 is done**: `scripts/smoke.sh` builds + previews + walks + tears down; `--live` walks the Pages
  URL. **It is not in `check.sh`** — the gate stays browser-free.
- **The account page is not a `<form>`.** `user-edit.tsrx` draws `.form` as a `div` of `Field`s, so a
  row must assert an input by `name` (`input[name="displayName"]`), never `querySelector("form")`.
- **A component that hands out a link must take the path, not the href.** `EmptyState` took a finished
  `href` and drew a bare anchor; 39 call sites were one attribute away from the exploit. Ownership of
  the `href`+`follow` pair inside the component is what stopped it — apply that to any new one.
- **`link-check.mjs` reads tags, not lines.** Attributes span lines (the tab bar and the dev pages do),
  so the scanner walks from `<a` to the matching `>` counting braces, quotes and backticks; a
  line-based grep would miss exactly the multi-line cases it exists for. T-48's scanner needs the same
  block-walking discipline.
- **The report journey needs POST(8)**: the preview classifier buckets on `hash("jev:post:" + body) % 5`
  and only buckets 2/3/4 escalate.
- **A shared Chromium profile makes the walk flake** — profiles are unique per run and removed on exit.
- **`go()` must resolve against the served base**; a leading slash drops the `/LuaPlot/` base.
- **Measure a flavour through `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia`**, never by flipping `data-theme` from JS.
- **`/bookmarks` carries an internal horizontal scroller** (`.tabs`, `overflow-x: auto`); the
  **document** does not scroll. The breakpoint row asserts `documentElement`.
- **`:has()` is available in the walk's Chromium** (`Chromium 105+`), and it is the only way to pick
  "the first card that actually draws an author link" in one selector (T-47's row 30) without
  flattening the whole grid into the page expression.
- **Bundle numbers**: `dist` 1.1 MB; JS 728 KB raw / ~187 KB gz; CSS 23.8 KB gz; largest asset the
  JetBrains Mono Latin woff2 at 40,404 B. Budget 300 KB gz — met.
- **T-28B is done**: `postStatusSchema` (`visible | removed`), `removePost()`, `livePost()`,
  `getPost` still answers by id.
- **Counts** (memory adapter; the walk's own journeys add rows as they run, so never assert a bare
  total): characters 28 (27 public), lorebooks 6 (5 public), presets 5, personas 3, posts 12 (11 listed,
  post 6 removed), reports 5 (3 open, 2 concluded), comments 22, sessions 2, bookmarks 8 (one dead),
  notifications 6 (3 unread), profiles 7, follow edges 15. `/dev/data`'s *Characters* cell reads the
  **page** count (24 = `PAGE_SIZE`), not the fixture total.

- **`visualViewport.height` is shadowable on the instance (T-36a).** `Object.defineProperty(vv,
  "height", { configurable: true, value: n })` works — the read-only accessor lives on the prototype
  and does not block an own property — and `delete vv.height` puts the real getter back. Dispatch
  `new Event("resize")` **on `vv`**: a `window` resize is not the event a keyboard fires.
- **The walk does not run at 360 by default.** `--window-size=360,740` is the browser's, but a tab
  opened through `/json/new` measures **500×653** (probed 2026-11-01), and every row that clears its
  override returns to *that*. A row of phone geometry therefore takes its **own** `360×740` override
  and compares `scrollWidth` against the `innerWidth` it read, never against a constant — T-36a's
  first run reported `scrollWidth 490`, which looks like a broken page until you see the viewport was
  500.
- **A character's session entry is `Continue` after any earlier row opened one.** `click("Start a
  session")` matched nothing on the second visit; take `clickAny(["Continue", "Start a session"])`.
- **`requestAnimationFrame` does fire in headless Chromium** for the active tab, so a rAF-coalesced
  writer (`viewport.ts`) is walkable — no `Emulation.setPageVisibility` or timer fallback needed.
- **A red proof that fails on a poll's timeout message is not the proof an accept line asks for.**
  T-36a's first red run said `timed out waiting for --keyboard-inset to read 320px`; the row now
  catches that poll and re-reads the token **and the dock's padding**, so the failure names the two
  numbers a reader can act on. Do the same wherever a row's accept line says what the message must say.
